    "# Getting Data from an API and Cleaning the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## APIs\n",
    "API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface that software uses to access data, server software, or other applications.  In simple terms, it is a software intermediary that allows two applications to \"talk\" to each other.  They are quite versatile and can be used on web-based systems, operating systems, database systems and computer hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified example would be when you sign into Twitter from your phone you are telling the Twitter application that you would like to access your account. The mobile application makes a call to an API to retrieve your TWitter account and credentials. Twitter would then access this information from one of its servers and return the data to the mobile application.  This is an example of a web API, and will be what we use in this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs depend on the owner of the dataset. The data can be either offered for free or be available at a cost. The owner can also limit the number of requests that a single user can make or the amount of data they can access.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "Broadly, data wrangling (also called data munging) can be split into 3 tasks (in no particular order and often repeated):\n",
    "- data cleaning (e.g., renaming columns, reordering, handling duplicates or missing data, filtering to desired subsets)\n",
    "- data transformation (changing the data's structure to facilitate downstream analysis, such as transposing the data, ensuring there is only one observation per row)\n",
    "- data enrichments (e.g., merge new data with the origina data by appending new rows/columns or use the original data to create new data).\n",
    "This activity just scratches the surface of this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "- Begin to understand the frequently employed steps in data wrangling\n",
    "- Explore an API to find and collect temperature data\n",
    "- Use binary search to find the city we want\n",
    "- Clean the data\n",
    "- Visualize the results\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, we will collect daily temperature data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) API.  The site is here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2 and is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminsitration (NOAA).  NOAA's mission is to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, ocean, and coasts,to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources.\n"

    "\n",
    "Online documentation about how to access specific data can be found here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2.  The API limits users to 5 requests per second and 10,000 requests per day.  (If requests exceed this amount, you will get a clinet error with a status code in the 400s.  More about status codes can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status.)\n",
    "\n",

    "We will use a convenience function for making requests with a specific endpoint and providing our token.  The requests library manages turning our dictionary of search parameters to a query string.  This function was written by Stefanie Molin, the author of Hands on Data Analysis with Pandas (see references).  To use it, you will need to first replace \"PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\" with your personal token.\n",

    "For this activity, we are interested in \"CITY\".  We will need to find the location ID for the city we want.  However, there are almost 2000 cities to choose from, so we don't want to look through the list to find the id by visual inspection.  We will choose to focus on San Francisco, one of the largest cities in Northern California.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function (written by Stefanie Molin, the author of Hands on Data Analysis with Pandas) conducts a binary search.  Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask the API to return the cities sorted.  The function get_item() makes the first request to see how big the list is and then it looks at its first value.  Then it compares the item we are searching for (alphabetically) to the current name, and depending on the result, then continues the search in half the data.  This process repeats recursively until the result is found or until there is no more splitting of data that is possible.  Recursion means we call the function from inside itself and carefully define a base condition so that the search will eventually stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because APIs often restrict the number of requests that can be made, using an efficient search algorithm (e.g., binary) is helpful in limiting the requests needed to find what we want."
